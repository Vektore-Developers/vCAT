## Summary
*Accurate core orientation is fundamental to reliable structural geology and mineral resource estimation. Nevertheless, errors during the transfer of orientation marks to the core remain a common and often overlooked issue in the industry.* These misalignments can cascade through the data pipeline, leading to costly mistakes in structural interpretation, geological modeling and decision-making.

To effectively address this challenge, Vektore has developed the vCAT (Vektore Core Alignment Tool) - a simple, non-electronic tool designed to improve the accuracy of orientation transfer. By releasing vCAT as **a free, open-source tool under the Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**, Vektore aims to make this solution tool widely accessible, enabling professionals, educators, and field teams worldwide to adopt more reliable core alignment practices and enhance the quality and trustworthiness of structural data acquisition.
